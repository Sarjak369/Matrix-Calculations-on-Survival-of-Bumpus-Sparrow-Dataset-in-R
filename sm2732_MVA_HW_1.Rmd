#   (2) Alar_extent: the distance in millimeters from tip to tip of extended wings; 
#   (3) L_beak_head: length of head in millimeters from tip of beak to the occiput; 
#   (4) L_humerous: length of humerus in fractions of an inch; 
#   (5) L_keel_sternum: length of sternum in fractions of an inch

# Covariance 
# Covariance evaluates how the mean values of two random variables move together. 
# More precisely, covariance refers to the measure of how two random variables in a data set will change together. 
# A higher number denotes higher dependency.
# Positive Covariance -> A positive covariance between two variables indicates that these variables tend to be higher or lower at the same time.
# Negative Covariance -> When the calculated covariance is less than negative, this indicates that the two variables have an inverse relationship.


# Calculating the Covariance of the matrix survival_data_matrix
cov(survival_data_matrix)

# Inferences -> We can clearly see a lot of correlation among the different features from the
#               the covariance matrix of survival_data_matrix. The Total_length seems to be 
#               highly positively dependent with the Alar_extent (9.100000), which makes sense 
#               intuitively. Also, Total_length is less positively dependent with the L_humerous
#               so we can say that there is not much relation between them (0.870000).

# Calculating the Covariance of the matrix non_survival_data_matrix
cov(non_survival_data_matrix)

# Inferences -> We can clearly see a lot of correlation among the different features from the
#               the covariance matrix of non_survival_data_matrix. The Total_length seems to be 
#               highly positively dependent with the Alar_extent again, which makes sense 
#               intuitively. Also, L_beak_head is less positively dependent with the L_humerous
#               so we can say that there is not much relation between them.
#               The difference we can note here is, the values are higher than the one which
#               were in the survival category. The value between Alar_extent and and 
#               L_keel_sternum is 4.065608 for non_survival_data_matrix and for the 
#               survival_data_matrix, the value if 0.88. This means that the sparrow will
#               most likely not survive if the Alar_extent is more positively correlated or dependent
#               with the L_keel_sternum.



# Correlation
# Correlation is a measure that determines the degree to which two or more random 
# variables move in sequence.
# A correlation matrix is computed for the goal when dealing with large amounts of 
# data is to find patterns. 
# As a result, a correlation matrix is used to look for a pattern in the data 
# and determine whether the variables are highly correlated.


# Calculating the Correlation of the matrix survival_data_matrix
cor(survival_data_matrix)

# Calculating the Correlation of the matrix non_survival_data_matrix
cor(non_survival_data_matrix)

# Inferences -> We know that Correlation is simply indicates how strongly two variables are related.
#               As we can see from the correlation matrix of survival_data_matrix, the correlation
#               values of L_keel_sternum and L_humerous is 0.4165447 which is positive and less strongly
#               related.
#               For the non_survival_data_matrix, the value ofL_keel_sternum and L_humerous is 0.6677936 
#               which is again positive and less strongly related.
#               Now, since the range of the values in the correlation values is always between -1 to +1,
#               if we compare the two correlation matrices of survival_data_matrix and non_survival_data_matrix
#               there is still a decent difference in the values. 
#               So we can infer that if the correlation value of L_keel_sternum and L_humerous is more strongly
#               related, then the sparrow will most likely not survive.. Again, this also depends on the 
#               correlation values of other features. 
#               This is how we can compare and draw the insights from the correlation matrix of a given data.
