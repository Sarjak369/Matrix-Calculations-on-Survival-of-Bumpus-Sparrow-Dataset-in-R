# Matrix-Calculations-on-Survival-of-Bumpus-Sparrow-Dataset-in-R


With the help of Bumpus_sparrows.csv, I tried to create 2 separate matrices: 1 for survived sparrows and 1 for non-survived sparrows.
Then, I calculated col_means, covariance matrices and correlation matrices and drew the inferences from the result. 
I have used R Programming language for this.
